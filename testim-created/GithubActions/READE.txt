Here are the instructions:

if your repo create the following directory:

.github/workflows
create the following file called 'testimdemo-github-actions.yml'

edit the file 'testimdemo-github-actions.yml' and add the following lines:

name: testim-github-actions
on: [push]
jobs:
  run-testimio-cli:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm install -g @testim/testim-cli
      - run: testim --version
      - run: testim --label "githubactions" --token ${{ secrets.TESTIM_TOKEN }} --project ${{ secrets.TESTIM_PROJECTID }} --grid "Testim-Grid" --result-label "githubactionsExample" --turbo-mode



NOTES:

Because of this line 'on: [push]'

This will build on commits, you can also change it to run if theres a comment or pull request as well. We do recommend using secrets so that the testim token
and project are not exposed in the github actions log.
Finally in this example is going to kick off any test with the label called 'githubactions' but you can also have done a test plan, test name, or test suite.
